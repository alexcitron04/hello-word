hi humans 

im alex citron im a chef, but in this modern era, im start to learn code for many opportunities i saw inside the kitchens, so i need to fix some activities, im starting whit python, actually my friend francisco he (heÂ´s a programmer) introduces me in to this world, i like it, but some time the grammar is sooo dificult because, my native language is spanish, one of my goals is develop an app to help thousand of cookers to make more easier some daily task, as inventory, manage checklist, even request orders, divide task for areas and many more.
